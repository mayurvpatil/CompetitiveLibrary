Given an array which contains 1-9 keys in a phone dial pad. To traverse this key pad you can only move either 1 step up/down/left/right first and then 3 steps agian in up/down/left/right direction or vice versa.

Find out the number of unique destinations you can reach with a path of length 4 starting from a source key. Additionaly this dial pad has one disabled key (x), so you cannot take that path.

Example:
Input: [1,2,3,4,x,6,7,8,9] , Source: 3
Output: 7
